        "LinkedList" to "A LinkedList, just like a tree and unlike an array, consists of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence. Each node contains data and a pointer. The data in a node can be anything, but the pointer is a reference to the next item in the LinkedList. A LinkedList contains both a head and a tail. The Head is the first item in the LinkedList, and the Tail is the last item. A LinkedList is not a circular data structure, so the tail does not have its pointer pointing at the Head, the pointer is just null.

DoublyLinkedList also has a head node, head node's next pointer reference to first node.The last node's next pointer reference to NULL, but if last node's next pointer reference to first node called Circular DoublyLinkedList.DoublyLinkedList is very convenient to find previous and next node from each node.",

        "Stack" to "A Stack is a basic data structure with a \"Last-in-First-out\" methodology. Which means that the last item that was added to the stack, is the first item that comes out of the stack. A Stack is like a stack of books. In order to get to the first book that was added in the stack (the bottom book), all of the books that were added after need to be removed first. Adding to a Stack is called a Push, removing from a stack is called a Pop, and getting the last item inserted into the stack without removing it is called Top. The most common way to implement a stack is by using a LinkedList, but there are also StackArray (implemented with an array) which does not replace null entries, and there is also a Vector implementation that does replace null entries.",

An abstract method must be implemented by the abstract class sub-classes. Abstract classes are extended. An interface is like a blueprint/contract of a class. It contains empty methods that represent what all of its subclasses should have in common. The subclasses provide the implementation for each of these methods. Interfaces are implemented.",

        "What is serialization? How do you implement it?" to
                "Serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes in order to store an object into memory so that it can be recreated at a later time while still keeping the objects original state and data. In Android you may use either the Serializable or Parcelable interface. Even though Serializable is much easier to implement, in Android it is highly recommended to use Parcelable instead, as Parcelable was created exclusively for Android which performs about 10x faster then Serializable because Serializable uses reflection which is a slow process and tends to create a lot of temporary objects which may cause garbage collection to occur more often.",

        "What is Singleton class?" to "A singleton is a class that can only be instantiated once.This singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

Once an object is no longer referenced and therefore is not reachable by the application code, the garbage collector removes it and reclaims the unused memory.",

        "Difference between method overloading and overriding." to "Overloading happens at compile-time while Overriding happens at runtime: The binding of overloaded method call to its definition has happens at compile-time however binding of overridden method call to its definition happens at runtime. Static methods can be overloaded which means a class can have more than one static method of same name. Static methods cannot be overridden, even if you declare a same static method in child class it has nothing to do with the same method of parent class. /nThe most basic difference is that overloading is being done in the same class while for overriding base and child classes are required. Overriding is all about giving a specific implementation to the inherited method of parent class. /nStatic binding is being used for overloaded methods and dynamic binding is being used for overridden/overriding methods. Performance: Overloading gives better performance compared to overriding. The reason is that the binding of overridden methods is being done at runtime. /nPrivate and final methods can be overloaded but they cannot be overridden. It means a class can have more than one private/final methods of same name but a child class cannot override the private/final methods of their base class. Return type of method does not matter in case of method overloading, it can be same or different. However in case of method overriding the overriding method can have more specific return type (refer this). Argument list should be different while doing method overloading. Argument list should be same in method Overriding.",
